Notes:

â€”- open dispatch.html or report.html

dispatch.html
- dispatch.html is a mockup of the desktop interface for Dispatchers
- There are two main parts: 
	1. The Incidents table
		- New, In Progress, and Completed incidents appear here
		- Newly submitted incidents are added to the top of the table
		- In theory, the user should be able to interact with each table entry to dispatch guards, mark as complete, view incident report, etc.
		- Each table entry has a 'status circle' that  is color coded: red (new), orange (in progress), green (complete)
		- Data are hard-coded

	2. The Users panel
		- All guards on duty appear here
		- Their names, status, and locations are shown
		- The dispatch button only appears if the guard is on duty (active)
		- Each list item has a 'status indicator': green (on duty), grey (off duty), orange (dispatched)

report.html
- mockup of the incident reporting screen as seen on a mobile device
- just some field titles and text boxes
