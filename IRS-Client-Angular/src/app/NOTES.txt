I. Components
    - Components are like 'Controllers' -- they have their own class, variables, methods, 
        their own view (template)
    - Naming: name.component.ts, location.component.ts
    - app.component.ts is the PARENT COMPONENT
    - Child components can be added to the AppComponent

    How to add a Child Component:
    1. Create a new file, ex. location.component.ts
    
    In location.component.ts, 
    2. Import component from angular/core 
        import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    3. Declare it as a component, with the following properties: selector, and template or templateUrl
        (there are more, only if necessary)
        - selector - the html DOM name where the template will be inserted
            ex. selector: 'location-component';
            where in the html of the parent component, we can insert the view of this component
            by inserting <location-component></location-component> somewhere
        - templateUrl - the external html file of the component
            ex. templateUrl: 'location.component.html';
    4. Create a class called LocationComponent
        Below the code from 3, add: export class LocationComponent { }
    
    In app.module.ts, we need to have a reference for this new component
    5. Import the child component
        import { LocationComponent } from './location.component';
    6. Add LocationComponent to the declarations
        declarations: [
            AppComponent,
            LocationComponent
        ]
    7. Create the view for LocationComponent
        - Add a new file in src/app, called location.component.html
            - The file name must match the templateUrl in location.component.ts
    8. Add a DOM for LocationComponent in app.component.html
        - Somewhere in app.component.html, add: <location-component></location-component>

    
    How to pass data from AppComponent to a child component: 
    In the child component (ex. location.component.ts),
    1. Import the Input library from angular core :
        import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';
    
    2. In the class LocationComponent, declare a new @Input() variable, as follows:
        @Input() variable_name: variable_type;
        ex. @Input() locations: Location[]; // locations is expecting an array of objects called Location

    3. Assuming you already have <location-component></location-component> somewhere in app.component.html, 
        bind the data, as follows:
        <location-component [variable_name]="dataSource"></location-component>

        ex. <location-component [locations]="locationsArray"></location-component>,
        where 'locations' is the variable name from LocationComponent, and
            'locationsArray' is the variable name from AppComponent
