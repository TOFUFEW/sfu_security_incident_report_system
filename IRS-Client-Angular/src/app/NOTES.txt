I. Components
    - Components are like 'Controllers' -- they have their own class, variables, methods, 
        their own view (template)
    - Naming: name.component.ts, location.component.ts
    - app.component.ts is the PARENT COMPONENT
    - Child components can be added to the AppComponent

    How to add a Child Component:
    1. Create a new file, ex. location.component.ts
    2. In location.component.ts, 
        - Import component from angular/core 
            import { Component } from '@angular/core';
        - Declare it as a component, with the following properties: selector, and template or templateUrl
            (there are more, only if necessary)
            - selector - the html DOM name where the template will be inserted
                ex. selector: 'location-component';
                where in the html of the parent component, we can insert the view of this component
                by inserting <location-component></location-component> somewhere
            - templateUrl - the external html file of the component
                ex. templateUrl: 'location.component.html';
        - Create a class called LocationComponent
            export class LocationComponent { }
    3. In app.module.ts, we need to have a reference for this new component
        - Import the child component
            import { LocationComponent } from './location.component';
        - Add LocationComponent to the declarations
            declarations: [
                AppComponent,
                LocationComponent
            ]
    4. Create the view for LocationComponent
        - Add a new file in src/app, called location.component.html
            - The file name must match the templateUrl in location.component.ts

    5. Add a DOM for LocationComponent in app.component.html
        - Somewhere in app.component.html, add: <location-component></location-component>
